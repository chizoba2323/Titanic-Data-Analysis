# Titanic Data Analysis with Power BI  

## Description  
This project provides an in-depth analysis of the Titanic dataset using *Power BI. The dataset was **cleaned, formatted, and visualized* to uncover insights about passengers aboard the Titanic. The analysis answers key questions regarding passenger demographics, class distribution, fare prices, and relationships on board.  

## Data Processing  
- *Data Cleaning: The dataset was imported into **Power BI*, where missing values were handled, data was formatted, and necessary transformations were applied.  
- *Data Analysis*: Visualizations and calculations were created to answer key questions about the passengers.  

## Key Questions Answered  
1. *Total Passengers*: How many passengers were aboard the Titanic?  
2. *Passenger Class Distribution*: How many passengers were in each class?  
3. *Gender Breakdown*: How many passengers were male and female?  
4. *Age Grouping*: Passengers were categorized into four groups:  
   - 0–19: Teenagers  
   - 20–39: Youth  
   - 40–59: Adults  
   - 60+: Elders  
5. *Age Group Analysis*: Which age group had the most and least passengers?  
6. *Family Onboard*: How many passengers had siblings or children on board?  
7. *Fare Analysis*: Sum, average, minimum, and maximum fare prices.  
8. *Embarkation Analysis*: How many passengers embarked at each location?  
9. *Gender-Class Distribution*: How many male and female passengers were in each class?  

## Tools Used  
- *Power BI* (Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Visualization)  

## Insights & Conclusion
